					Gingerbread refers to a broad category of baked goods,
					typically flavored with ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and
					cinnamon and sweetened with honey, sugar, or molasses.
					Gingerbread foods vary, ranging from a soft, moist loaf
					cake to something close to a ginger snap.

			<h2>Etymology</h2>
			<hr />
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				Originally, the term gingerbread (from Latin zingiber via
				Old French gingebras) referred to preserved ginger. It then
				referred to a confection made with honey and spices.
				Gingerbread is often used to translate the French term pain
				d'épices (literally "spice bread") or the German terms
				Pfefferkuchen (lit. "pepper cake," because it used to
				contain pepper) or Lebkuchen (of unclear etymology; either
				Latin libum, meaning "sacrifice" or "sacrificial bread," or
				German Laib for loaf or German for life, leben). Pepper is
				also referenced in regional names like pepperkaker or perník
				(originally peprník). The meaning of gingerbread has evolved
				over time; for centuries the word was used for a traditional
				European pastry, closer to a cookie, like what is used to
				make gingerbread men. In the United States, the first known
				recipe for "Soft gingerbread to be baked in pans" comes from
				American Cookery (1796) by Amelia Simmons.

			<h2>History</h2>
			<hr />
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				Gingerbread is claimed to have been brought to Europe in 992
				AD by the Armenian monk Gregory of Nicopolis (also called
				Gregory Makar and Grégoire de Nicopolis). He left Nicopolis
				(in modern-day western Greece) to live in Bondaroy
				(north-central France), near the town of Pithiviers. He
				stayed there for seven years until his death in 999 and
				taught gingerbread baking to French Christians. It may have
				been brought to Western Europe from the eastern
				Mediterranean in 11th century.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since the 13th century, Toruń gingerbread was made in Toruń,
				then State of the Teutonic Order (now Poland). It gained
				fame in the realm and abroad when it was brought to Sweden
				by German immigrants. In 15th-century Germany, a gingerbread
				guild controlled production. Early references from the
				Vadstena Abbey show that the Swedish nuns baked gingerbread
				to ease indigestion in 1444. It was the custom to bake white
				biscuits and paint them as window decorations. In England,
				gingerbread was also thought to have medicinal properties.
				16th-century writer John Baret described gingerbread as "a
				kinde of cake or paste made to comfort the stomacke."
			</p>
			<p>
				Gingerbread was a popular treat at medieval European
				festivals and fairs, and there were even dedicated
				gingerbread fairs. The first documented trade of gingerbread
				biscuits in England dates to the 17th century,[citation
				needed] where they were sold in monasteries, pharmacies and
				town square farmers' markets. One hundred years later, the
				town of Market Drayton in Shropshire, became known for its
				gingerbread, as is displayed on their town's welcome sign,
				stating that it is the "home of gingerbread". The first
				recorded mention of gingerbread being baked in the town
				dates to 1793, although it was probably made earlier, as
				ginger had been stocked in high street businesses since the
				1640s. Gingerbread became widely available in the 18th
				century.
			</p>
			<p>
				Gingerbread came to the Americas with settlers from Europe.
				Molasses, which was less expensive than sugar, soon became a
				common ingredient and produced a softer cake. The first
				printed American cookbook, American Cookery by Amelia
				Simmons, contained seven different recipes for gingerbread.
				Her recipe for "Soft gingerbread to be baked in pans" is the
				first written recipe for the cakey old-fashioned American
				gingerbread.

				<h3>England</h3>
				<p>
					In England, gingerbread may refer to a cake, or type of
					cookie or biscuit made with ginger. In the biscuit
					form, it commonly takes the form of a gingerbread man.
					Gingerbread men were first attributed to the court of
					Queen Elizabeth I, who served the figurines to foreign
					dignitaries. Today, however, they are generally served
					around Christmas. Gingerbread was a traditional
					confectionery sold at popular fairs, often given as a
					treat or token of affection to children and lovers
					"sweethearts" and known as a "fairing" of gingerbread -
					the name retained now only by Cornish fairings. This
					crisp brittle type of gingerbread is now represented by
					the very popular commercial version called the ginger
					nut biscuit. "Parliament cake" or "Parlies", a very
					spicy ginger shortbread, were eaten (in the same way as
					salty snacks with beer), with whisky, rum or brandy,
					during midday breaks, by the members of the original
					(pre-1707) Scottish Parliament, in a secret backroom
					(ben the hoose), at a tavern and shop in Bristo Street
					in Edinburgh's Potterrow, behind the University, run by
					a Mrs Flockhart, AKA Luckie Fykie, the landlady who is
					thought to be the inspiration for Mrs Flockhart in
					Walter Scott's Waverley. The recipe is mentioned in
					Christian Isobel Johnstone's The Cook and Housewife's
					Manual (also known as Meg Dod's Cookery) (1826)
					published under the pseudonym of "Mrs. Margaret Dods,
					of the Cleikum Inn, Saint Ronan's", evoking the
					character of Margaret Dods, the hostess of the Cleikum
					Inn in Walter Scott's novel Saint Ronan's Well
					(1823).It was immensely popular, and in which, she used
					characters Scott's to give commentary on preparing
					national specialties. Parkin is a form of soft
					gingerbread cake made with oatmeal and treacle which is
					popular in northern England, originating in Yorkshire.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>United States</h3>
				<p>
					In the United States, this form of gingerbread is
					sometimes called "gingerbread cake" or "ginger cake" to
					distinguish it from the harder forms. French pain
					d'épices is somewhat similar, though generally slightly
					drier, and involves honey rather than treacle and uses
					less spice than other breads in this category.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Benelux</h3>
				<p>
					In the Netherlands and Belgium, a soft and crumbly
					gingerbread called peperkoek, kruidkoek or ontbijtkoek
					is popularly served at breakfast time or during the
					day, thickly sliced and often topped with butter.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Germany</h3>
				<p>
					In Germany gingerbread is made in two forms: a soft
					form called Lebkuchen and a harder form, particularly
					associated with carnivals and street markets such as
					the Christmas markets that occur in many German towns.
					The hard gingerbread is made in decorative shapes,
					which are then further decorated with sweets and icing.
					The tradition of cutting gingerbread into shapes takes
					many other forms and exists in many countries, a
					well-known example being the gingerbread man.
					Traditionally, these were dunked in port wine. At
					Oktoberfest in Munich, it's customary for men to buy
					large gingerbread cookies in the shape of a heart, with
					a ribbon for their sweetheart to wear around their
					neck. The cookies are iced with romantic phrases like
					"Ich liebe dich" (I love you). In Ashkenazi Jewish
					cuisine, the honey cake eaten at Rosh Hashanah (New
					Year) closely resembles the Dutch peperkoek or the
					German Lebkuchen, though it has wide regional
					variations.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Nordin Nations</h3>
				<p>
					In the Nordic countries, the most popular form of
					ginger confection is the pepperkaker (Norwegian),
					pepparkakor (Swedish), brunkager (Danish), piparkökur
					(Icelandic), piparkakut (Finnish) and piparkūkas
					(Latvian) or piparkoogid (Estonian). They are thin,
					brittle biscuits that are particularly associated with
					the extended Christmas period. In Norway and Sweden,
					pepperkaker/pepparkakor are also used as window
					decorations (the pepperkaker/pepparkakor are a little
					thicker than usual and are decorated with glaze and
					candy). Many families bake
					pepperkaker/pepparkakor/brunkager as a tradition.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h3>Switzerland</h3>
				<p>
					In Switzerland, a gingerbread confection known as
					"biber" is typically a two-centimeter (approximately ¾
					of an inch) thick rectangular gingerbread cake with a
					marzipan filling. The cantons of Appenzell and St.
					Gallen is famous for biber, which are artfully adorned
					with images of the Appenzell bear or the St. Gallen
					cathedral respectively by engraving or icing.
				</p>

				<h3>Russia</h3>
				<p>
					In Russia, a gingerbread maker was first mentioned in
					Kazan cadastres in 1568.[23] Gingerbread confections
					are called pryaniki (sg. pryanik), derived from the
					Russian term for 'spices'. Historically three main
					centers of gingerbread production have developed in the
					cities of Vyazma, Gorodets, and Tula. Gingerbreads from
					Tver, Saint Petersburg, and Moscow were also well known
					in the Russian Empire. A classic Russian gingerbread is
					made with rye flour, honey, sugar, butter, eggs and
					various spices; it has an embossed ornament and/or text
					on the front side with royal icing.[24] A Russian
					gingerbread can also be shaped in various forms and
					stuffed with varenje and other sweet fillings.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Poland</h3>
				<p>
					In Poland, gingerbreads are known as pierniki
					(singular: piernik). Some cities have traditional
					regional styles. Toruń gingerbread (piernik toruński)
					is a traditional Polish gingerbread that has been
					produced since the Middle Ages in the city of Toruń. It
					was a favorite delicacy of Chopin when he visited his
					godfather, Fryderyk Florian Skarbek, in Toruń during
					school vacation. Kraków gingerbread is the traditional
					style of the former Polish capital.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Czech Republic</h3>
				<p>
					In Czech Republic, gingerbread is called perník and it
					is a popular Christmas biscuit and a decoration. Common
					shapes include hearts, stars and animals and
					gingerbread houses are also popular. Towns associated
					with perník include Pardubice[25] and Miletín, which is
					known for a trademarked gingerbread cake called
					miletínská modlidbička (Miletin's prayer).[26]
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Romania</h3>
				<p>
					In Romania, gingerbread is called turtă dulce and
					usually has sugar glazing.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Bulgaria</h3>
				<p>
					A variety of gingerbread in Bulgaria is known as
					меденка ("made of honey"). Traditionally the cookie is
					as big as the palm of a hand, round and flat, and with
					a thin layer of chocolate. Other common ingredients
					include honey, cinnamon, ginger, and dried clove.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Panama</h3>
				<p>
					In Panama, a confection named yiyinbre is a gingerbread
					cake made with ginger and molasses; it is typical of
					the region of Chiriquí. Another popular confection is
					quequi or queque, a chewy biscuit made with ginger,
					molasses, and coconut.
